## 1. Introduction to Text-to-Speech and Pyttsx3

Text-to-Speech (TTS) converts written text into spoken words, enabling accessibility, automation, and interactive applications. Unlike cloud-based TTS services (e.g., Google TTS or Amazon Polly), **pyttsx3** shines as an **offline** solution, leveraging your system's native speech engines:

- **Windows**: SAPI5
- **macOS**: NSSpeechSynthesizer
- **Linux**: eSpeak

This cross-platform, internet-free capability makes `pyttsx3` ideal for a wide range of projects. 🌐

---

## 2. Installation

Get started by installing `pyttsx3` and any platform-specific dependencies.

### General Installation
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
```

### Platform-Specific Requirements
- **Windows**: If you encounter issues with `win32com`, install `pypiwin32`:
  ```bash
  pip install pypiwin32
  ```
- **Linux**: Ensure `espeak`, `ffmpeg`, and `libespeak1` are installed (Debian/Ubuntu):
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install espeak ffmpeg libespeak1
  ```

> **Tip**: For other Linux distributions, use your package manager's equivalent commands.

---

## 3. Basic Usage: Making Your Program Speak

Let’s get `pyttsx3` talking with a simple "Hello World" example.

### Theory
- **`pyttsx3.init()`**: Creates a speech engine instance.
- **`engine.say(text)`**: Queues text for speaking.
- **`engine.runAndWait()`**: Processes the queued speech and blocks until complete.
- **`engine.stop()`**: Stops speech and clears the queue (good practice for cleanup).

### Code Snippet: Hello World
```python
import pyttsx3

# Initialize the TTS engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Text to be spoken
text = "Hello, world! This is pyttsx3 speaking."

# Queue the text
engine.say(text)

# Process and output the speech
engine.runAndWait()

# Cleanup
engine.stop()
```

---

## 4. Controlling Speech Properties

Customize the speech output by adjusting **rate**, **volume**, and **voice**.

### 4.1. Speech Rate (Speed)
Control how fast the speech is delivered (default: ~200 WPM).

```python
import pyttsx3

engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Get current rate
current_rate = engine.getProperty('rate')
print(f"Current speech rate: {current_rate} WPM")

# Slower speech (150 WPM)
engine.setProperty('rate', 150)
engine.say("This text will be spoken at a slower pace.")
engine.runAndWait()

# Faster speech (250 WPM)
engine.setProperty('rate', 250)
engine.say("Now, this text will be spoken much faster.")
engine.runAndWait()

engine.stop()
```

### 4.2. Volume
Adjust volume between `0.0` (silent) and `1.0` (maximum).

```python
import pyttsx3

engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Get current volume
current_volume = engine.getProperty('volume')
print(f"Current volume: {current_volume}")

# Half volume
engine.setProperty('volume', 0.5)
engine.say("This text will be spoken at half volume.")
engine.runAndWait()

# Full volume
engine.setProperty('volume', 1.0)
engine.say("This text will be spoken at full volume.")
engine.runAndWait()

# Very low volume
engine.setProperty('volume', 0.1)
engine.say("Can you hear me now? This is very quiet.")
engine.runAndWait()

engine.stop()
```

### 4.3. Voice Selection
List and select from available system voices.

```python
import pyttsx3

engine = pyttsx3.init()

# List available voices
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
print("Available Voices:")
for i, voice in enumerate(voices):
    print(f"  Voice {i}:")
    print(f"    ID: {voice.id}")
    print(f"    Name: {voice.name}")
    print(f"    Languages: {voice.languages}")
    print(f"    Gender: {voice.gender}")
    print(f"    Age: {voice.age}")
    print("-" * 20)

# Switch to a different voice (if available)
if len(voices) > 1:
    engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)
    print(f"Switched to voice: {voices[1].name}")
    engine.say("Hello, I am a different voice now.")
    engine.runAndWait()

# Try finding a female voice
female_voice_id = None
for voice in voices:
    if voice.gender == 'female':
        female_voice_id = voice.id
        break

if female_voice_id:
    engine.setProperty('voice', female_voice_id)
    print(f"Switched to a female voice (ID: {female_voice_id}).")
    engine.say("Greetings, I am a female voice.")
    engine.runAndWait()
else:
    print("No female voice found or gender info unavailable.")

engine.stop()
```

> **Note**: Voice availability and properties (e.g., gender) depend on your system's speech engines.

---

## 5. Saving Speech to an Audio File

Save synthesized speech as MP3 or WAV files for later use.

### Theory
- **`engine.save_to_file(text, filename)`**: Queues text to save as an audio file.
- **`engine.runAndWait()`**: Processes the save command.
- **Requirement**: `ffmpeg` is needed for MP3 on Linux.

```python
import pyttsx3
import os

engine = pyttsx3.init()

text_to_save = "This is a test to save speech to an audio file."
output_filename_mp3 = "output_speech.mp3"
output_filename_wav = "output_speech.wav"

# Save as MP3
print(f"Saving speech to {output_filename_mp3}...")
engine.save_to_file(text_to_save, output_filename_mp3)
engine.runAndWait()
print(f"Speech saved to {output_filename_mp3}")

# Save as WAV
print(f"Saving speech to {output_filename_wav}...")
engine.save_to_file(text_to_save, output_filename_wav)
engine.runAndWait()
print(f"Speech saved to {output_filename_wav}")

# Verify files
if os.path.exists(output_filename_mp3):
    print(f"File '{output_filename_mp3}' created successfully.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to create '{output_filename_mp3}'. Ensure ffmpeg is installed if on Linux.")

if os.path.exists(output_filename_wav):
    print(f"File '{output_filename_wav}' created successfully.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to create '{output_filename_wav}'.")

engine.stop()
```

---

## 6. Event Handling (Callbacks)

Synchronize actions with speech using callbacks for events like utterance start, word start, or utterance end.

### Theory
- **`engine.connect(topic, callback_function)`**: Registers a callback for events like:
  - `started-utterance`
  - `started-word` (may not work on all platforms, e.g., Windows SAPI5)
  - `finished-utterance`

```python
import pyttsx3

def onStart(name):
    print(f"Starting to speak: {name}")

def onWord(name, location, length):
    print(f"  Word spoken: '{name[location:location+length]}' (Location: {location}, Length: {length})")

def onEnd(name, completed):
    print(f"Finished speaking: {name}. Completed: {completed}")

engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Register callbacks
engine.connect('started-utterance', onStart)
engine.connect('started-word', onWord)
engine.connect('finished-utterance', onEnd)

# Queue sentences
text1 = "Hello, this is the first sentence."
text2 = "And this is the second sentence."
engine.say(text1, name='Sentence 1')
engine.say(text2, name='Sentence 2')
engine.runAndWait()

engine.stop()
```

---

## 7. Advanced Considerations and Troubleshooting

- **Blocking with `runAndWait`**: This method pauses your program. Use threading for non-blocking applications (e.g., GUI apps).
- **Stopping Speech**: Use `engine.stop()` to interrupt speech and clear the queue.
- **Error Handling**: Wrap `pyttsx3` calls in `try-except` blocks to handle initialization or file-saving errors.
- **Voice Availability**: Limited voices may be available depending on your system.
- **Saving Issues**: Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and in PATH for MP3 saving on Linux. Check filenames/paths for issues.

> **Tip**: Always test on your target platform, as behavior varies across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
